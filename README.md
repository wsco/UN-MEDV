# Making an effective data visualization
**Titanic Passenger data**
** Wesley Scoggin January 2018**

### Feedback:
**Martha:**
This is really cool, I like the visualizations. I can make assumptions about the data just because I saw the movie.
**1.** I noticed that the visualizations all load in order when it is opened and then stays on the last graph. And they had pop-up labels

**2.** I think I would have liked to also know how many people where in each class and gender. It could be that more women survived % wise but I don’t know out of how many women compared to how many men.

**3.** Colors and class categories are consistent making it easier to process.

**4.** Main takeaway is that more women survived % wise in each class and overall

**5.** Why is class 3 first before class 1 & 2? Is it the same as first class, coach, etc.?

**6.** Other feedback:
  a. the last visualization the class and gender it doesn’t specify which column is the gender.

  b.The true/false can be misleading. It doesn’t tell you what is true.. that they died or they survived.

  c.I am assuming that this is part of larger report but it doesn’t actually say that it is about the Titanic ship that sank in 1912.

  d.I think it would tell a different story if it was a stacked bars that way it is  % of the whole so you wouldn’t need as many visualizations and you wouldn’t need to know how many people there were in each category.

**Marc:**
I noticed the initial load of the page cycled through all the categories (All, Class, Gender, Class and Gender), then ending with the category buttons on the left...an automatic drill down effect.

Do you have passenger lists to go with this data?  What is the source?

Females of all classes had a disproportionately higher survival rate than males in all classes; all female classes had above 50%.  Even the highest male survival rate, 1st class males, was less than 40% while the lowest class females had a survival rate of 50%.  It is interesting that the male 2nd and 3rd classes had similar survival rates, while the 1st and 2nd class females had similar survival rates.  

One had a much better chance of surviving the RMS Titanic sinking if one was a 1st or 2nd class female.  "Woman and children first"...

Green is the percentage of people that survived? and males on left and females on right? (Found it on the "tooltip"/"mouseover" popup)  
What was the total number of people?
